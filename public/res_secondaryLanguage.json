I don't just 'build'; I constantly contemplate why a specific technology was chosen and how to create a better structure and user experience.",

Beyond just listing data, I maximized user experience through **AI real-time translation** and **data refining logic**.\n\n### What I built\n- **Legacy Refactoring**: Converted a CRA + JS environment 100% to Vite + TypeScript, reducing build time by 95% and ensuring type stability.\n- **AI-based Multilingual Support**: Integrated **Google Translate API** to provide real-time Korean translation for English achievement data.\n\n### Troubleshooting: Solving Slow Build Speeds and Runtime Type Errors\n- **Issue**: HMR speed exceeded 10 seconds as features were added, decreasing productivity. Frequent runtime data inconsistency errors due to JS-based project characteristics.\n- **Solution**: Replaced Webpack-based CRA with esbuild-based **Vite**. Stabilized API response data processing logic by introducing a Strict Type System.\n- **Result**: Reduced local server startup time by **90%** (15s → 1.5s), build speed by **95%**, and achieved **0 runtime errors** after implementation.\n\n### Technical Focus\n- **Strict Type System**: Designed precise interfaces excluding the `any` type\n- **Technical SEO**: Completed Sitemap.xml generation and Google Search Console indexing",
